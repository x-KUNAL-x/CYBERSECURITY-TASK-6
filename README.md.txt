Here’s a simple step-by-step explanation of how you can complete Task 6 of the Cyber Security Internship in an easy and clear way, with all the required parts:

✅ Goal of Task 6
Learn how to create strong passwords, test their strength, and understand how to protect them against attacks like brute force and dictionary attacks.

✍️ Step-by-Step Guide
🔹 Step 1: Create 4–5 Passwords
Make different passwords with varying strength. For example:

Password	Complexity Type
123456	Very Weak
Marjani123	Weak (common name + number)
Marjani@2025	Medium (symbols + year)
M@rJ@ni!_#456	Strong (symbols + mix cases + numbers)
T!ger$Fly_Safe_9*	Very Strong (long, random words + symbols)
🔹 Step 2: Use an Online Password Strength Checker
Go to websites like:

https://password.kaspersky.com/

https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/

https://passwordmeter.com/

Test each password and note the result:

How strong is it?

How long would it take to crack it?

What are the suggestions to improve it?

🔹 Step 3: Analyze the Results
Make a simple table like this:

Password	Strength	Time to Crack	Suggestions
123456	Very Weak	< 1 second	Too simple, avoid using common numbers
Marjani123	Weak	Few seconds	Add symbols, mix cases
Marjani@2025	Medium	Minutes	Longer is better
M@rJ@ni!_#456	Strong	Centuries	Very strong
T!ger$Fly_Safe_9*	Very Strong	Millions of years	Great password
🔹 Step 4: Write Down Best Practices (Tips)
From what you learned, write these tips:

Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols

Make passwords longer (12+ characters)

Avoid using your name, birthdays, or common words

Use passphrases (e.g., Blue$Sky_Elephant!92)

Never reuse the same password

Use a password manager to store strong passwords safely

🔹 Step 5: Research Password Attacks
Summarize common attacks:

Brute Force Attack: Tries every possible combination. Long and complex passwords take longer to crack.

Dictionary Attack: Tries common words and known passwords. Avoid simple or common words.

🔹 Step 6: Answer Interview Questions
1. What makes a password strong?
A strong password is long, random, and includes upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

2. What are common password attacks?
Brute force, dictionary attacks, phishing, and keyloggers.

3. Why is password length important?
Longer passwords take more time to crack and are more secure.

4. What is a dictionary attack?
An attack where hackers try a list of common passwords or words.

5. What is multi-factor authentication (MFA)?
Using a second step (like OTP or fingerprint) to log in safely.

6. How do password managers help?
They store complex passwords securely so you don’t have to remember them.

7. What are passphrases?
Passwords made of several words or phrases, like Green$Tiger_Jumps9*.

8. What are common mistakes in password creation?
Using short passwords, names, birthdates, or reusing passwords.
